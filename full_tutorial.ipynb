    "# Tutorial on Modeling of Learning Under Uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will be introduced to three modeling papers on reinforcement learning. These papers study the phenomenon of organizationa learning under uncertainty trough the use of agent based models who learn from n-Arm bandits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The models we will study are:  \n",
    "**1. March and Denrell (2001)**\n",
    "This paper introduced the so called Hotstove effect. The idea being that if agents choose between two options with the same mean, one with variance in its feedback and one without, the agents will learn to choose the variant without variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Posen and Levinthal (2012)**\n",
    "This paper expands the model from Denrell and March (2001) and studies how agents learn in an environment with ten options, all of them with variance. It studies the effects of different shocks and environmental changes as agents chase a moving target.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Puranam and Swamy (2016)**\n",
    "This paper expands the model from Denrell and March (2001) through the process of coupled learning. Two agents, not one as before, learn of the perfoemance of two options. The catch is that the performance is based upon their coupled action and the agetns do not know what the other agent is doing. Through time the agents learn to cooperate. Interestingly, if agents start with the same choice, they reach the optimal choice faster than if they started with mixed choices. This holds even if they start choosing the wrong option.\n",
    "\n",
    "The document builds a general agent who can update its beliefs and choose options in different ways, the bandits can also draw values from different distributions. These differences come from the different papers. This tutorial introduces the three papers at once in order to allow you to play around. At every point you can change the forms of the distributions or how the agents learn, in most cases the results you will find will be clear. In other cases you will need to find the aprropriate parameters.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Note:** You can find narrower tutorials that cover just one paper at a time in the repository: https://github.com/jparrieta/bandits.  \n"

    "# Basic Building Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first sections, I will present the basic building blocks. Namely, the àgent's learning and decision processes and how we generate options in the environment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Agents\n",
    "The agents follow a few simple actions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Choose\n",
    "The agents choose one option based upon their attraction to this option. Here there four versions of choosing options: greedy, e-greedy, softmax, and aspiration-level based. Denrell and March (2001) use aspiration-levels, Posen and Levinthal (2012) the other three.  \n",
    "* If the agent selects options via softmax, The agent's level of exploration is determined by the parameter tau. A small tau leads to high exploitation, a high tau to infinite exploration. Due to limitations in the floating point operation we cannot use taus lower that 0.002.  \n",
    "* If greedy is chosen, there is no free parameter to specify the level exlorativeness of the agent.  \n",
    "* If e-greedy is chosen, then the e parameter specifies the percentage of times the agent chooses an option other than the greedy one.  \n",
    "* If aspiration is chosen, then an option is drawn from a Polya urn with probabilities specified by the prior learning. To use aspiration level one needs to choose self_update = self_choose = \"aspiration\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Update\n",
    "There are three ways of updating. Two are based on the Bush Mossteller equation one on aspiration-level search.  \n",
    "* The Bush Mossteller updating uses an Exponentially Recency Weighted Average (Sutton and Barto, 2018). The updating is based on phi. Phi can be constant, or varying according to 1/(k+1). Posen and Levinthal uses the 1/(k+1) version.  \n",
    "* The aspiration-level version is used in Denrell and March (2001). Here if the payoff received was higher than the aspiration then the probability of choosing that option is directly increased. If the payoff received is lower than the aspiration then the probability of choosing that options is lowered. The other options get updated accordingly. To use aspiration level one needs to choose self_update = self_choose = \"aspiration\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Learn\n",
    "Learn is a subroutine. It receives two parameters, the number of periods and the bandits to learn from. \n",
    "It initalizes two lists and starts a for loop that run for the specified number of periods.  \n",
    "The period starts by asking the agent to choose an option. The payoff of the option is calculated by measuring the option's value. This is explained in the next section. The period ends with the updating of the agent's attractions and the storage of the choice and payoff. After this a new period starts, the choices are stored and returned to the user.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Reset\n",
    "This function resets the attractions of the agent. It takes one value, the number of bandits in the environment.  "
