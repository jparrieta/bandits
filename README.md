This repo includes the code for running some of the seminal papers on organizational learning under uncertainty

Currently, it includes the code for Denrell and March (2001) and Posen and Levinthal (2012). 

The next code to be included is Puranam and Swamy (2016).

In the last commit, I updated the Denrell and March (2001) code so that the agents are equivalent between simulations. 

You can run this code directly by opening the following binder in your browser:
