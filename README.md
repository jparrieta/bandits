# bandits
This repo includes the code for running some of the seminal papers on organizational learning under uncertainty.    

Currently, it includes the code for Denrell and March (2001), Posen and Levinthal (2012), and a full tutorial where the same agents and bandits replicate both papers.

The next code to be included is Puranam and Swamy (2016).
